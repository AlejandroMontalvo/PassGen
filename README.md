# ![Alt Text](./imgs/SecurePasswordGenerator.png)

This is my own implementation of a secure password generator using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Everything is handled clientside, meaning that nothing is ever sent back to the server. [Here](https://github.com/AlejandroMontalvo/secure-password-generator/blob/main/LICENSE) it is in action.

# Overview

Below is an overview of each file:

## Root Directory

`index.html` - The defualt website page. All aspects of the site are brought together within this file.

`script.js` - Includes the main logic behind the settings button/password modifiers.

`style.css` - Styling for all the elements on the page.

All images are stored within the `img` file directory.
