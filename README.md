# ![Alt Text](./imgs/SecurePasswordGenerator.png)

This is my own implementation of a secure password generator using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I started this project as a personal challenge to test my knowledge of the web development tools mentioned earlier. I believe I was successfully able to apply myself, and overcome gaps in my knowledge to create a fully featured product.
